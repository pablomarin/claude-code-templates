# Memory & Learning

**You have persistent memory.** Your auto memory directory survives across sessions. Use it.

- **Save learnings**: When you solve a tricky bug, discover a project pattern, or learn a preference, write it to your auto memory (`MEMORY.md` or topic files)
- **Save solutions twice**: Bug fixes go to both `docs/solutions/` (project knowledge base) AND your auto memory (personal recall)
- **Before stopping**: Ask yourself "Did I learn anything worth remembering?" — if yes, save it
- **Before compaction**: The PreCompact hook will remind you. Save any session learnings before they're compressed
- **Keep it concise**: `MEMORY.md` loads every session (first 200 lines). Move details to topic files
