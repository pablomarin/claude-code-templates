# Finish Branch Workflow

> **Use this command after the PR is reviewed and approved.**
> This command handles merging the PR and cleaning up the worktree/branch.

---

## When to Use

- After all PR review comments have been addressed (via `/code-review`)
- After the PR is approved by reviewers
- When you're ready to merge to main and clean up

**Note:** This command does NOT commit, push, or create PRs. Those steps happen before this command. This command only merges and cleans up.

---

## Phase 1: Merge PR

### 1.1 Find the PR

```bash
BRANCH_NAME=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)
gh pr view "$BRANCH_NAME" --json state,url,title
```

**If no PR exists:** Tell the user they need to create a PR first. STOP.

### 1.2 Check if already merged

```bash
gh pr view "$BRANCH_NAME" --json state --jq '.state'
```

If state is `MERGED`, skip to Phase 2 (cleanup).

### 1.3 Ask user for merge confirmation

**Ask the user:**
> "PR is ready: [URL]. Shall I merge it to main and clean up?"

**STOP and wait.** Do NOT proceed until the user explicitly says yes.

If the user says no or wants to wait — STOP HERE. They can run `/finish-branch` again later.

### 1.4 Merge the PR (only after user confirms)

```bash
gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch
```

> **Why squash?** Keeps main history clean. Use `--merge` or `--rebase` if the user prefers.
> The `--delete-branch` flag auto-deletes the remote branch on GitHub.

**If merge fails** (e.g., merge conflicts, required checks pending):
- Tell the user what failed
- STOP and let them resolve it
- Do NOT force merge

---

## Phase 2: Cleanup (After Merge)

### 2.1 Detect current context

```bash
# Check if we're in a worktree
if [[ "$(pwd)" == *".worktrees/"* ]]; then
  echo "STATE: IN_WORKTREE"
  # Extract worktree name from path
  WORKTREE_NAME=$(basename "$(pwd)")
  echo "WORKTREE_NAME: $WORKTREE_NAME"
else
  echo "STATE: NOT_IN_WORKTREE"
fi
```

### 2.2 Get branch name

```bash
BRANCH_NAME=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)
echo "BRANCH_NAME: $BRANCH_NAME"
```

### 2.3 Navigate to main repository

```bash
# Go back to main repo root (works from inside worktree)
cd "$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)/.."
echo "Now in: $(pwd)"
```

### 2.4 Remove the worktree

```bash
git worktree remove ".worktrees/$WORKTREE_NAME" --force
echo "✓ Removed worktree: .worktrees/$WORKTREE_NAME"
```

### 2.5 Delete local branch

```bash
git branch -d "$BRANCH_NAME"
echo "✓ Deleted local branch: $BRANCH_NAME"
```

**If branch not fully merged (force delete with user confirmation):**
```bash
git branch -D "$BRANCH_NAME"
```

### 2.6 Delete remote branch (if not already deleted)

```bash
git push origin --delete "$BRANCH_NAME" 2>/dev/null || echo "Remote branch already deleted (gh pr merge --delete-branch handled it)"
```

### 2.7 Prune stale references

```bash
git worktree prune
git fetch --prune
echo "✓ Pruned stale references"
```

### 2.8 Switch to main and pull

```bash
git checkout main
git pull
echo "✓ Updated main branch"
```

---

### 2.9 Restart development servers from main

> ⚠️ **Servers may still be running from the deleted worktree directory, or not running at all.**

Restart the development servers from the main directory so the user is back to a working state. Use the project's start commands from CLAUDE.md.

```bash
# Example (replace with actual project commands from CLAUDE.md):
# npm run dev
# uv run uvicorn main:app --reload
```

---

## Cleanup Summary

After successful cleanup, report to user:

```
✓ All done:
  - PR merged to main (squash)
  - Removed worktree: .worktrees/[name]
  - Deleted local branch: [branch]
  - Deleted remote branch: [branch]
  - Pruned stale references
  - On main branch (up to date)
  - Development servers restarted from main
```

---

## If NOT in a Worktree

If the user is not in a worktree (e.g., working directly on a feature branch):

1. **Skip worktree removal** (steps 2.3, 2.4)
2. **Still delete branches** (steps 2.5, 2.6)
3. **Still prune and update main** (steps 2.7, 2.8)

---

## Error Handling

### PR not found
- Check if a PR exists for this branch: `gh pr list --head "$BRANCH_NAME"`
- The user may need to create the PR first

### Merge fails
- Check for merge conflicts or required checks
- Tell the user what failed and STOP

### Worktree removal fails
- Check if worktree has uncommitted changes
- Use `--force` flag if changes are already in the merged PR

### Branch deletion fails
- If "not fully merged": The PR might not be merged yet. Confirm with user.
- If "remote ref does not exist": GitHub may have auto-deleted on merge. This is fine.
